# Drum Pad

Made with react-typescript. You can play a preset number of sounds when you press/click on any of the displayed keys.

My learnings:

- Seperating state logic from presentation using custom hooks
- Single responsibility principle by way of function implementation

Planned Improvements:

- Improve on styling and accessibility
- Expand functionality e.g record and play
